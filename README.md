# 3D Robot Arm with Finger Control â€“ WebGL Project

## Overview

This project implements an interactive **3D Robot Arm** simulation using **WebGL**. The robot consists of a base, lower arm, upper arm, and three fingersâ€”each with its own 3 degrees of rotational freedom along the X, Y, and Z axes.

Users can manipulate each joint using sliders, allowing for real-time visualization and testing of hierarchical modeling and transformation matrices.

## Features

- âœ… **Full 3D Hierarchical Robot Arm**
  - Base, Lower Arm, Upper Arm, and 3 Fingers.
  - Each component supports rotation around X, Y, and Z axes.

- ðŸŽ› **Interactive Controls**
  - 18 sliders for angle manipulation.
  - Individual rotation control for each body part and finger.

- ðŸŽ¨ **Color and Geometry**
  - Color-coded cube rendering.
  - Reusable cube geometry used to construct each arm segment.

- ðŸ’¡ **Matrix & Shader Management**
  - Uses transformation matrices (modelViewMatrix, projectionMatrix).
  - Written in GLSL shaders for vertex transformation and coloring.

## Technologies Used

- WebGL (via `webgl-utils.js`)
- GLSL Shaders (inline in HTML)
- HTML5 + JavaScript
- `MV.js` for matrix and vector math utilities

## How to Run

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open `robotArm.html` in a WebGL-supported browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
3. Use the sliders to rotate each part of the robot arm along desired axes.
4. Observe the hierarchical updates reflected in real-time on the canvas.

## Lessons Learned

- Mastered the concept of **hierarchical transformations** in 3D.
- Learned **real-time UI binding** using sliders to update 3D objects.
- Developed proficiency with **WebGL shaders** and attribute buffers.
- Gained experience in **modular code organization** using MV and shader utility scripts.

## Known Issues

- âš  None â€“ the project is currently **fully functional** with no bugs.


## Future Improvements

- Add **animation toggle** to automate arm motion.
- Export pose data for saving/loading configurations.
- Enhance visuals using lighting and shading techniques.
